<div id="post">
<p>There are people who can study the night before a test and ace it. I am not one
of those people.</p>

<p>Although I loved school, I was really bad at studying. In fact, I hated
studying. I studied by reading my notes and the textbook, trying to make sure I
understood the <em>“fundamentals”</em> and <em>“core concepts”</em>. Of course, I did this in
the days or hours leading up to a test. Even when I started to study earlier, I
found I needed to go back over content I already thought I had <em>“learned”</em>.
Studying was boring, discouraging, and ineffective.</p>

<p>During university I stumbled upon a technique that allows me to learn and retain
information extremely well — spaced repetition.</p>

<h2 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h2>

<p>The gist is you make a set of flashcards using software and practice them every
day. Every time you review a card, you can tell the program if you knew the
answer and how easily you recalled it.</p>

<p>Now, that’s easier said then done. This technique is not a shortcut to learning
by any measure. Learning using spaced repetition takes a lot of time and effort.
You must review your cards every day.</p>

<p>We all know that over time our memory for facts decays. It turns out that if we
cause our mind to recall a fact right before we are about to forget it, we will
strengthen the memory. In more concrete terms, if we learn a fact, recall it in
increasing intervals of say 10 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and so on we will
be able to remember it for much longer. For a better overview of the science,
checkout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>Spaced Repetition Software manages this for us. Here’s an example of one of my
cards from a Computer Architecture course:</p>

<p><img src="/media/img/spaced/1.png" alt="Example Card" />
<img src="/media/img/spaced/2.png" alt="Example Card Back" /></p>

<p>Note the time on this card is a little extreme because I haven’t reviewed this
card in over a year. You can see that I provide a lot of context on my cards. I
also included an excerpt of the lecture slide. I’ll talk more about constructing
good cards in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="learning-or-memorizing">Learning or Memorizing</h2>

<p>When I’ve told friends about the technique, they are skeptical that I actually
learn anything and posit that I am just blindly memorizing. I too initially
thought flashcards were only for pure memorization.</p>

<p>I initially tried spaced repetition originally because a lot of concept heavy
courses still had facts or rules that I frequently forgot. During an exam I
would know what the question was asking, how to answer the question and even
most of the facts or rules. However most is not all.</p>

<p>As I used spaced repetition more often, I found myself adding cards to
“memorize” the relationship between concepts or ideas. For example I had a card
to differentiate between <em>conflict cache misses</em> (a miss caused because the
cache associativity is too low) and <em>coherence misses</em> (a miss caused because
some external force invalidated a cache line, like in a SMP).</p>

<p>At first glance this appears like I’m memorizing the differences between the two
concepts. In some sense I am, but if I can correctly contrast between the two
misses have I not learned the concept? Even more interesting is that with this
knowledge I can actually understand the implications in the real world.</p>

<p>After a while, I learned to create flashcards that required really understanding
the material if I was to answer the questions correctly. This is when I started
to see the benefit. Trying to memorize a card without understanding it can work
for the short term, but after longer intervals I found recalling facts extremely
difficult.</p>

<h2 id="creating-cards">Creating Cards</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki</a> for my spaced repetition. It’s free for desktop and can sync
with your mobile devices.</p>

<p>I skip class and instead sit in front of my large monitor with the lecture
slides on one side of my screen and <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki’s</a> card editor on the other. I
read the slide (and surrounding slides) to determine what the concepts are. I
create cards that cover these concepts from multiple angles. When in doubt I add
more concepts than less.</p>

<p>The authors of another spaced repetition software, <a href="[http://www.supermemo.com/]">SuperMemo</a>, has an
excellent set of rules for creating cards called “<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">The 20 rules of formulating
knowledge in learning</a>.” I’ll outline the rules I felt particularly
helpful here.</p>

<h3 id="stick-to-the-minimum-information-principle">4: Stick to the minimum information principle</h3>

<p>It’s easier to learn small and concise pieces of information.</p>

<h3 id="cloze-deletion-is-awesome">5: Cloze deletion is awesome</h3>

<p>Almost all of my cards use Cloze deletion. It’s much more effective than
standard flashcard with a front and back. You can use the cloze deletion for
multiple parts of a concept. This allows you to recall the concept from
different sides.</p>

<p><img src="/media/img/spaced/3.png" alt="Example Card" />
<img src="/media/img/spaced/4.png" alt="Example Card Back" /></p>

<h3 id="and-8-use-images-and-image-cloze-deletion">6 and 8: Use Images (and image cloze deletion)</h3>

<p>Here’s an example of a Tomasulo’s CPU register renaming technique with a visual
cloze deletion. Notice how the only the only item removed is the register
status. That’s the level of detail that I found useful. I use the Anki plugin
<a href="http://tmbb.bitbucket.org/image-occlusion-2.html">Image Occlusion</a> to create image cloze deletions quickly.</p>

<p><img src="/media/img/spaced/5.png" alt="Example Card" /></p>

<h3 id="and-10-avoid-sets-and-enumerations">9 and 10: Avoid Sets and Enumerations</h3>

<p>Remembering sets and enumerations (ordered lists) is unnecessarily difficult.
You can often convert these into more meaningful and useful cards. Usually I do
this by contrasting and comparing concepts as in the inclusions versus exclusion
cards earlier.</p>

<p>If you can’t find a better way to represent the concepts, cloze deletion on a
list can really help out. This card describes what happens during a page fault.
Every time I review the card I see all but one step, allowing me to think about
the step in the context of the other steps.</p>

<p><img src="/media/img/spaced/6.png" alt="Example Card" /></p>

<h3 id="and-16-combat-interference">11 and 16: Combat Interference</h3>

<p>Interference is when two cards are similar and you confuse the concept and
therefore the answer. Inference is extremely frustrating, especially if the two
cards are separated by time.</p>

<p>Consider two similar concepts far apart from each other in the deck. You may
learn the first concept perfectly. Later the second concept is hard to learn but
you eventually figure it out. As time goes on the first concept comes up again
and you’ve forgotten about it.</p>

<p>One of the ways I deal with interference is by providing lots of context in the
card to differentiate concepts as in the cache hierarchy example. I sometimes go
back to cards and modify them to be dissimilar.</p>

<h3 id="omit-needless-words">12: Omit needless words</h3>

<p>If you cards contain a lot of unnecessary words, you brain takes longer to make
the connection to the concept. I tend to write verbosely so I actively try to
limit the amount of wording on a card, eschewing grammar.</p>

<h3 id="redundancy-is-ok">17: Redundancy is OK</h3>

<p>I often have several cards that cover the same concepts from different angles.
Sometimes using cloze deletions, images, or comparisons to similar concepts.
These all can help strength memories. Approaching a concept from different
angles also ensures you can recall the concepts in different situations.</p>

<p><img src="/media/img/spaced/7.png" alt="Example Card" /></p>

<h2 id="a-topological-sort-of-knowledge">A Topological Sort of Knowledge</h2>

<p>A theory on learning I once heard was that in order to learn a concept you need
to have a hook to hang it on. In other words, you need to see where an idea fits
in the bigger picture before you can internalize it.</p>

<p>One way to do this for lectures is to pre-read lecture slides. That way when the
professor is presenting the information, you’ll already know where it fits. I
did this for my Data Structures and Algorithms class before I used flashcards
and it was a boon for my understanding and my exam mark.</p>

<p>Ideally, we would be presented with information in the perfect order for
learning, a topological sort of knowledge so to speak. However, it’s difficult
(perhaps impossible) to construct a perfect ordering. Spaced repetition allows
us to approximate this idea.</p>

<p>When you are reviewing cards, they will not necessarily be in the order the
lecturer presented them. As you review cards that contain a concept and the
surrounding concepts, you will be exposed to the concept in the context of the
bigger picture through repeated interleaving. That is, in between cards on a
particular concept the software will be showing you other cards that are often
about related concepts.</p>

<p>As you see these interleaving, you’ll start to understand the similarities and
differences between concepts. Once you can do this, you’ll be able to answer the
cards quickly and with great accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="reviewing-cards">Reviewing Cards</h2>

<p>I review my cards every day. If you don’t they will build up. It takes me about
an hour every day and I often split it up into two 30 minute sprints. Sometimes
I find it convenient to review cards on my iPhone with the mobile app.
Especially on a long bus ride. The desktop app is fine, but I use a plugin
called <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3192665669">Full Screen</a> to maximize the window on my Mac to reduce
distractions. Recently, I’ve started to stand while reviewing to limit my
wandering mind.</p>

<p>Tony, while proofreading this post noted that he thinks I should attribute the
better grades with Spaced Repetition to just studying more. He is probably
correct. Spaced Repetition allows me to study effectively (not necessarily
efficiently). I do spend a huge amount of time creating cards and reviewing them
but the value I gain is immense.</p>

<h2 id="test-time">Test Time</h2>

<p>A great way to study for the kinds of exams I took in engineering is to practice
problem sets or old exams. I find problems similar to or in the same style as
those that will be on the exam. Before space repetition, each problem with a new
concept required a haphazard search of lecture slides and my notes. Even once I
had understood the concept and successfully completed the problem it was
difficult to redo a similar problem later on during the exam study period. I
couldn’t recall the specifics of the concept.</p>

<p>I found that because I had studied the concepts in the months leading up to the
exam, the time I spend practice problems is efficiently used. When I did a
problem, I had already learned the concept and its relationship with other
concepts. Once I complete many of the practice problems, I’ll review the entire
deck of cards for the course using the Filtered Decks feature. Filtered Decks
allow me to refresh my memory on the entire course and to pinpoint areas that
need concentration.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I urge students to consider alternative studying methods. It can be surprising
what works for you. When you find a technique that works well for you it can
change your whole attitude to exams and studying. The most valuable lesson I
learned in university was how to learn.</p>
